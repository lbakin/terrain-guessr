## About this project

### I was reaching a point in my studying of front-end web development where I didn't think I had any projects that accurately represented both my knowledge and general interests.
### I was curious how hard it would be to place yourself if you were dropped somewhere on the earth and had only a topographic map to guide you. I think there's a lot of insight to be gained from looking at the world through a topographic lens. This applies mostly to the natural world, but you can also see how variations in the earth's surface influence the diverse cultures in our world.
### This project was written using primarily vanilla js because I wanted to test and push my understanding of pure js. I worry that I am overreliant on shortcuts in jQuery or react.js and wanted to make sure I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals.

## Next Steps

### Add tests
### Add asynchronous loading, especially with the maps since that seems to be what causes the page to load slowly sometimes
### Figure out a solution to make sure people understand how the zoom modifier works. Can be as simple as adding an explanation to the end screen, but I'd like to figure out something more elegant
### Add a street view option, especially in the pop-up
### Add a timer, potentially with a penalty
### Integrate overlay options that allows for various views, especially that of pure elevations displayed in colors or contours
