## About this project

### I was curious how hard it would be to place yourself if you were dropped somewhere on the earth and had only a topographic map to guide you. I think there's a lot of insight to be gained from looking at the world through a topographic lens. This applies mostly to the natural world, but you can also see how variations in the earth's surface influence the diverse cultures in our world.

## Current Improvement Focus

### Adding a leaderboard and a timer.

## Next Steps

### Create a mobile friendly version. This will be hard since I think panning around on both maps simultaneously is a key part of the guessing process, but I think it is feasbile to make
### Add asynchronous loading, especially with the maps since that seems to be what causes the page to load slowly sometimes
### Add tests
### Figure out a solution to make sure people understand how the zoom modifier works. Can be as simple as adding an explanation to the end screen, but I'd like to figure out something more elegant. Perhaps making the modifier flash when someone zooms out and drawing attention to it.
### Add a street view option, especially in the pop-up
### Integrate overlay options that allows for various views, especially that of pure elevations displayed in colors or contours
