Terrain geoguessr:


- integrate plugin that displays elevation in rgb
    + create label on side that indicates elevation range in map area

- make sure map is accessibility prioritized
- async load up main map, if only to show off that I can do it.
    + can potentially take a sec to load if running land check on continent polys needs to be repeated a bunch





You start zoomed into a certain spot. You've got x amount of time to figure out where you are. Points awarded based on distance from starting location. Everytime you zoom out past original scope, you lose a certain amount of points. 

Features needed: 
- main map section that displays terrain
- height indicators
- scale
- buttons to indicate zoom in/out and warning to indicate if next zoom out will cause point penalty
- return to start button
- normal map popout where you can pinpoint where you are
- menu
- other pages:
    + about
    + how to play
    + start a new game
    


Features wanted:

- toggling other geographic features for a points penalty (helps people get a chance for some points if they're completely lost with not much time left)
    + waterbody names
    + roads
    + city names
    + lat or long (for obviously huge point penalties)

- change density of topographic lines for more/less points
- ability to change orientation
- user accounts and allow tracking info



Considerations:

- best way to display terrain? 
    + color code with bar on the side indicating heights
    + topo lines
    + hillshading, but not sure how values should be transmitted
    + should there be satellite imagery underneath?


other thoughts: 
- the way this map displays the esri/imagery feature seems like a potentially good place to start: https://en-ca.topographic-map.com/maps/m1u/Wisconsin/


value that holds location clicked on in streets map
calculate distance between this value and startingLocation

why are maps not properly showing whole world? investigate that css issue
